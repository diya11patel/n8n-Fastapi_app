 n8n Docker Setup (Self-hosted)
Pros:
Full Control:
You have complete control over your infrastructure, security policies, and storage.

Custom Extensions:
Easily install custom nodes, libraries, or run custom Python/JavaScript code.

Resource Isolation:
Runs inside a container, so it‚Äôs isolated and can be deployed in Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, etc.

Data Privacy:
Ideal for internal workflows where sensitive data shouldn't leave the organization's network.

Offline Capability:
Can run in environments without internet access (e.g., air-gapped systems).

Integration with Private Networks:
Direct access to internal databases, filesystems, or services not exposed to the internet.

Scalability (with effort):
Can be scaled using Docker Compose or orchestrated in Kubernetes with persistence and horizontal scaling.

Cons:
Manual Setup Required:
Requires managing SSL (via NGINX or Traefik), reverse proxies, and background execution (e.g., using PM2, Docker restart policies).

Monitoring & Backups:
You need to set up and manage backups, logging, and uptime monitoring.

Not Instantly Scalable:
Scaling requires infrastructure changes, which need devops expertise.

Maintenance Overhead:
You must regularly update the container image, handle downtimes, and manage secrets.

‚òÅÔ∏è n8n Cloud (Managed Service)
Pros:
Zero Setup Time:
Instantly available. No need to install Docker, Node.js, or configure anything manually.

Automatic Scaling & Uptime:
Scales automatically under load, and includes built-in reliability.

Built-in Security:
HTTPS, OAuth, Credential Encryption, and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) are pre-configured.

Easy Webhook Integration:
Public URLs are immediately available, enabling webhook use without exposing local ports.

Data Backups:
Regular automated backups handled by n8n Cloud.

No Infrastructure Management:
You don‚Äôt have to worry about VM costs, storage, or patching security vulnerabilities.

Cons:
Limited Customization:
You cannot install custom dependencies or native modules in the environment.

Cost:
Comes with a monthly subscription fee, depending on your plan.

Privacy Concerns:
Data flows through a third-party cloud system. Not ideal for highly sensitive internal use cases.

Execution Limits:
Some plans may restrict the number of executions, workflows, or duration.
